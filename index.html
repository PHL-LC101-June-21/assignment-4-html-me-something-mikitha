                  <h2> Earlier Digital Work</h2>
                  <p id=testP class="funParagraph">Hello! In class for LaunchCode I go by Michelle, but my illustrator "pen name" is Miki. I decided to use this space to show off some of the art I've done in the last few years, some of the books I illustrated, and a couple of my more recent pieces. I haven't done a ton of drawing lately, so it's been nice to look back to my old work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This first set is from the early 2010's, when I was settling into a new style of digital art after spending a lot of time drawing and painting with real-life materials (yuck) in college. I liked to use a watercolor paper layer to get a good texture, then sketch and color underneath that texture to get a storybook effect. I still look back on these old pieces really fondly, which is sort of rare for my old art.

                     <h2> Books I Illustrated</h2>
                     <p>When I was finishing college, I started looking for freelance work as an illustrator. My first book, Milo's Flower Bed, is definitely rough but it's probably my favorite book process-wise. I discovered quickly that this process I enjoyed (the watercolor texture process I described above) was not conducive to making deadlines. For later books, like “Because Dragons Love Milk” and “Goodnight Lad”, I developed a much faster method that used no linework. Linework takes forever.

                   <h2> Current Work</h2>
                   <p>These last few pieces were done more recently. I went through a pretty bad bout of artist’s block after the books I illustrated, since I burned myself out pretty bad. I eventually found a happy medium between doing art for money and doing art for me. I’ve been working on branching out to more fan art (like the “Summoner” below, she’s my character from a Final Fantasy MMORPG) and more leisurely digital painting (like “Lutai” below, a portrait I drew of a friend’s Dungeons and Dragons character). If you like my work you can follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mikitharp/"> my Instagram</a>, and I'll post there again someday.
